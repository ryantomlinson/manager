My aim is that we’re a cohesive team that delivers and grows beyond expectation. We can’t do this alone individually. We each play a part in being a high performing team but in order to be one we have to understand what makes one. Some of this is known but a big part of this we can only learn together.

My role is to put the spotlight on you, as an individual and team, to do what I can to help you progress your career in the direction you want.

To give you an understanding of how I like to work and to give you some context before we get to know each other better, I’ve put some thought into what are the core tenets of how I like to operate.

##Leaders create leaders
It’s equally as important for you to grow as a leader as it is for me. I don’t see my role as telling you what to do and you shouldn’t expect that either. Instead I’m here to give context. If I’m doing that right then you should know what your purpose on the team is and where we are headed. You don’t need to ask me to do the right thing. Most of the time you know much better than I do about what “the right thing” to do is. To understand this concept better I encourage everyone on my team to watch Greatness by David Marguet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmdLcyES_Q based on the book Turn The Ship Around by the same guy.

We can only work this way if we’re both doing our jobs right. A lot of managers say shit like “don’t come to me with problems, come with solutions”. I don’t believe that at all. If you have solutions then sure, come with those. If you’re stuck on a problem, I’m always here for you.

##Resist Stasis
Without rigorous focus on continuous improvement it’s very easy, and typical, for organizations to produce systems and processes that are the result of short term decisions without forethought into the affect that decision has on the system as a whole. This is called “Systems Thinking”. This can easily manifests into a culture of “this is how we do things here”. I want us to question the process together with an inquisitive mindset and a proactive viewpoint of “what’s the best way to do this?” over “what’s the prescribed way to do this in our company?”.
This mindset requires the skillset of making change. When we question the status quo we will see resistance and at times it won’t go our way. Successful change requires empathy and empathy is a skill. Learn and work on how you make change just as you would a new coding language or framework.

I’ve written more about my thoughts on this in a post called The Process Delusion http://www.ryantomlinson.com/the-process-delusion/

##1:1’s
I hold weekly 1:1’s with each of my team and monthly skip 1:1’s with non-direct reports. I prefer to do these in person but this isn’t always possible and so for remote folks I’m happy to do this over a video call. I’m less keen on any form of status update chat in our 1:1’s, though if there’s something you’re working on that you want to talk about then we can do so. My preference is that you’ve prepared topics that you want to chat about. Sometimes I will use these sessions for feedback (of each other) but typically I will give feedback synchronously when it occurs so that you have better context of the situation. I value SBI (situation, behaviour, impact) feedback and this is what I will relay to you and expect the same in return.

If you can’t make a scheduled 1:1 that’s fine but I will always follow up and look to re-schedule.

If you can’t get your work done in sensible hours then I’ve fucked up…not you!
Some may call it “work/life” balance but I just see it as optimal motivation. Do anything too much and you’re not going to be motivated to enjoy it. Spending time with family, running, playing video games, all contribute to your motivation at work. Work and life are not a balance, they fuel each other.

I do not value “heros” who work ridiculous hours. I just see that as an attempt to make your team mates (potentially) feel bad.

##Expect Implicit Trust
Trust is reciprocal. My default is that you have the best intentions and you’re doing the right thing. I’m not here to manage your time. If you need to take a couple of hours out then I trust you have everything under control. Communicate it, for sure, but purely to set expectations. I’m not clocking hours.

Being a software developer requires constant learning. It’s really hard to understand where to invest your time and which latest technology to look at. I suffer from this same problem. There’s too much new shiny. We can work on this together if you need any guidance but ultimately the key to growth is constant learning and I will invest as much as I can in helping you. You don’t need my permission to take time out to learn new things. Even in work time. If you’re busy with work 100% of the time then something is wrong.

##Build Global Relationships
We won’t succeed as a team if we’re optimizing locally. We need to understand the bigger picture of the organization to ensure we’re aligned and heading in the right direction. With that wider context we can make much better local decisions. Take the time to interact with those outside, as well as inside our team.

##We Succeed and Fail Together
Each failure is a learning opportunity that we share. Do your best, take risks and know that it’s safe to fail in our team because we will learn, improve and innovate as a result. If we can fail quicker then do that. Regardless I will always support you because we ALWAYS fail as a team, not as the direct result of any individual.
